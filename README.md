# Master's Dissertation -  Drowsiness Detection: A comparative study into feature extraction/descriptor methods in improving Supervised ML
**University of Sunderland '21 - Masters Dissertation solution for MSc Data Science.**

This solution is Python based **Supervised Learning model (SVM)** which has been enhanced using **Histogram of Gradients (HOG)** feature extraction/descriptor method for improving performance for drowsiness detection.

A prototype using this model has been implemented as well that uses Haar Cascade for face and eye detection on live video stream. The prototype predicts the probabilities for eye state (% of open) and alerts the user if the eyes are closed for more than 4-5 secs.
